# C and C++ Code Snippets

Various Code Snippets of C and C++ Code Created years ago plus some compiled exe files.  Many are from college classes many years ago, Programming for Engineers and CS101 at Lincoln Land Community College.  Some are just personal projects created around the same time.

Most are single function small projects.

Some that are mildly notable:

* Pi Calculator - (C) - Continuously calculates Pi.
* Several converters for metric to imperial units.

# Games

* Tug of War - (C++) - Bet points against the computer to pull to one side and win. (Created for CS101)
* Horse Race - (C++) - Wager points on horce races. (Created for CS101)
* Pearl Diver - (C++) - Dive under the water to collect pearls and avoid drowning and stingrays (Created for CS101)
* Dragon Spirit - (C++) - An abandoned project to create a text based RPG.  Third in a series of games, the previous 2 on the TI-85 Calculator (Unfortunately that code is lost).

# Education

* Friendly Multiplication - (C++) - A simple Multiplication Game
* Brutal Multiplication - (C++) - An impossible Multiplication Game (Made as a joke)
* Addition Worksheet Generator - (C++) - Outputs a randomized sheet of Addition Problems
* Multiplication Worksheet Generator - (C++) - Outputs a randomized sheet of Multiplication Problems
